    "# Introduction\r\n",
    "Efficient management of product information is essential for the success of e-commerce businesses. This information enables informed decision-making and facilitates effective marketing strategies. File handling plays a key role in being able to manage such data, and Python allows us to handle various file formats which are used to store such data.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In this project, we are going to learn how to load, modify, and save files of three popular file formats which are used in the industry to handle data. These formats are:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **CSV**: CSV or comma-separated value files come with the file suffix *.csv* and, as the name suggests, have data values separated by commas. Each data entry is placed on a new line, and typically, the first line tends to store the names of columns. In our dataset, a CSV file is used to store sales values for each product over 14 days.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **JSON**: JSON or JavaScript object notation files come with the file suffix *.json* and store data as key-value pairs, similar to dictionaries in Python. In our dataset, JSON files are used to store details such as product names, prices, and brands.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **TXT**: TXT or text files come with the file suffix *.txt* and generally useful for storing single variables like strings or integers. In our dataset, TXT files are used to store descriptions of products."

    "The dataset for this project has been provided in the *mainfolder.zip* file. It contains data about products for which the unique ID provided is the stock keeping unit or SKU for short. The ZIP file contains a structured collection of sales data and product information organized into a main folder with three key components:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Sales Data** (*sales_data.csv*): A CSV file that includes sales data for various products over a 14-day period. Each row corresponds to a different product, identified by a *Product_SKU*. The columns *Day1* through *Day14* represent the sales figures for each consecutive day.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Product Descriptions** (*product_descriptions* folder): This folder contains text files, each corresponding to a specific product identified by the SKU in the filename (e.g., *description_AISJDKFJW93NJ.txt*). These files provide descriptive information about the products.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Product Details** (*product_details* folder): This folder includes JSON files, again with filenames corresponding to product SKUs (e.g., *details_AISJDKFJW93NJ.json*). These files contain detailed attributes of the products, such as specifications, category, pricing, etc.\r\n",

    "- If you are using Google Colab:\r\n",

    "  - Once you have mounted Google Drive into your Google Colab VM or uploaded the zip file directly to the Google Colab runtime.\r\n",
    "    - You can use the *Files* section on the left to access the filesystem. You can right click on a file or folder to copy its path. This will be useful while specifying the source file in the `unzip` shell command.\r\n",
    "  - You will need to pass the location of the main folder into the `load_data()` function to load *sales_data.csv* file and the files in *product_details* and *product_description* folders.\r\n",
    "- Inside the `load_data()` function, you can:\r\n",
    "    - use the `csv.DictReader()` method to read the *sales_data.csv* file, and to store the data as dictionaries with key-value pairs where the keys correspond to the column names in the first row,\r\n",
    "    - use the `os.listdir()` method to obtain the names of the files and folders within a particular folder,\r\n",
    "    - use `os.path.join()` to construct file paths,\r\n",
    "    - use the `json.load()` method to load JSON files, and\r\n",
    "    - use the `open()` function to load the text files.\r\n",
    "-  As you need to use the SKUs as keys in all three dictionaries, you can ask a generative AI tool like ChatGPT on how to extract the SKU values in all three cases.\r\n",
    "    - In *sales_data.csv* they have been saved in a column titled *Product_SKU*\r\n",
    "    - For the other two, you need to extract the SKU from the file name: you must obtain the SKU which lies between the prefix and the suffix. Try using the in-built string function `split()` (additionally, you can use `replace()` if you wish to write the code in one line).\r\n",
    "    - Provide the data description and requirements to ChatGPT along with the libraries that you are using and ask it to generate code for the function.\r\n",
    "    - If you get stuck somewhere, you can ask ChatGPT to explain the code to you and you can make edits as required."

    "### Requirements\n",
    "- Define a function named `update()` that collects comprehensive information about a new or existing product from the user, validates the input, and modifies the respective dictionaries with product details, sales data, and product descriptions to reflect the addition or update of the provided product.\n",
    "- The function should accept three parameters:\n",
    "  - `product_details`: A dictionary containing product details. Each entry maps an SKU to its corresponding product details.\n",
    "  - `sales_data`: A dictionary containing sales data. Each entry maps an SKU to a list of sales quantities for the last 14 days.\n",
    "  - `product_descriptions`: A dictionary containing product descriptions. Each entry maps an SKU to its corresponding textual description.\n",
    "- The function performs several operations:\n",
    "  - Prompts the user to input the SKU, which must be exactly 13 characters long. If the SKU does not meet this requirement, print an error message and terminate the function without updating any dictionaries.\n",
    "  - Prompts the user to enter sales data for the last 14 days, which must consist of exactly 14 whole numbers separated by spaces. If the input does not meet this criterion, print an error message and terminate the function without updating any dictionaries.\n",
    "  - Collects product details from the user, including name, brand, model, specifications, price, and availability. These inputs are required but not subject to specific validation criteria for this function.\n",
    "  - Prompts the user for a product description, which is also required for successful product registration.\n",
    "- If all inputs are validated successfully, the function updates the `product_details`, `sales_data`, and `product_descriptions` dictionaries with the provided product information and prints a success message.\n",
    "- Returns a tuple containing the updated `product_details`, `sales_data`, and `product_descriptions` dictionaries in that order.\n",
    "- The function is designed for use when a new product is to be added to the system or when an existing product in the system needs to be updated, and requires the caller to pass the current state of the `product_details`, `sales_data`, and `product_descriptions` dictionaries."

    "In this task, learners are tasked with implementing a Python function named `dump_data()` that automates the process of persisting sales data, product details, and product descriptions into structured files within a specified directory. The function should efficiently organize and dump each type of data into its corresponding file format: CSV for sales data, JSON for product details, and plain text for product descriptions. This exercise challenges learners to apply file I/O operations, directory management, and data serialization techniques in Python, ensuring they gain practical experience with data persistence, manipulation, and organization on the filesystem."
